    <h2> &nbsp <b>Pesticidal properties of marigolds</b></h2>
    <p>
       &nbsp - Marigolds contain a certain scent called <b>“alpha-terpineol,”</b> which makes insects find them unappetizing. They also have a fragrance similar to basil, which insects don’t like to feed on.
    </p>
    <p>
        &nbsp - The <b>African Marigold</b> has the highest amount of phytochemicals, which is the type of fragrance that wards off insects. This also wards off bunnies, deer, and elk.

    <p>	&nbsp	There are about 52 natural <b>pest repellent</b> plants, but marigolds can be useful and can ward off lots of things that normal pesticides do just as well while being a very eco-friendly pesticide.
  &nbsp Marigolds contain a citrus-like scent in concentrations of 5-15%. 
		 &nbsp This natural aroma is powerful enough to repel pesky insects such as mosquitoes, flies, and ticks.
	 &nbsp By incorporating marigolds into our gardens, we can keep pests away from our crops while also enhancing the beauty of our flowers. Marigolds not only help to maintain a pest-free environment but also add to the overall aesthetic appeal of our gardens.</p>
<ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Garlic:</strong> A gardener's secret weapon, garlic is a natural deterrent for a wide variety of pests. Its pungent aroma makes it unpleasant for many critters, from aphids to ants.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Mint:</strong> Not only does mint add a fresh aroma to your garden, but it also repels insects. However, be cautious—mint can be an invasive species that spreads quickly, competing with other plants for space and nutrients.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Baking Soda:</strong> A kitchen staple with surprising garden benefits, baking soda creates an environment that is inhospitable to slugs, garden pests, and red ants.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lemon Essence:</strong> Citrus fruits, with their tangy scent and low pH, make for effective natural pesticides. The acidic properties of lemon and other citrus fruits (pH between 2.30-3.90) help to deter a wide range of insects.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Apple Cider Vinegar:</strong> Known for its versatility, apple cider vinegar is another potent natural repellent. It’s widely used in the West as a safe and effective way to keep pests away.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Lavender:</strong> This fragrant herb does more than just smell good—it also repels mosquitoes, wasps, and snails, making it a great addition to your garden or patio.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Citrus Fruits:</strong> Like marigolds, citrus fruits contain natural chemicals that insects find off-putting, making them another valuable ally in your pest control arsenal.
